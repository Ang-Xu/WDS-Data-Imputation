This code repository contains a series of methods for spatiotemporal data imputation in water distribution systems, including low-rank matrix/tensor completion methods (e.g., LAMC-TNN, HaLRTC, LATC), machine learning methods (e.g., KNN), and traditional methods (e.g., mean imputation). We have also made the pipeline dataset used in the experiments publicly available. For any questions, please contact the authors via email.
